                                <p class=" text-justify " style="font-size:13px">1.1 Sagi Rama Krishanam Raju Alumni Association of North America, Inc is a 501(c)(3) organization registered in Florida with EIN number 92-2398357 and has its registered office at 10253 Estuary Dr., Tampa, FL 33647, USA (“SAANA”). SAANA operates an online donation service website (“Website”) providing various services (“Services”), including the collection and processing of donations received (the “Donations”) from individual donors (the “Donors”). SAANA, Inc also administers grant programs independently from the Website.

                                    <br> <br> 1.2 These legal terms and conditions, in addition to any other terms and conditions applicable govern the use of the Services (“Terms of Service”) by the non-profit organizations (together referred to as the “Nonprofits” and each individually as a “Nonprofit”) that are registered as Registered Users with SAANA, Inc (as defined in clause 2.2 below). By registering and continuing to use or access the Website, you are agreeing as a Nonprofit to be bound by these Terms of Service with immediate effect. References in these Terms of Service to the “Nonprofit” or “you” (and similar) are references to you as a nonprofit or to any other eligible organization that has applied on your behalf to SAANA, Inc and/or has been registered by SAANA, Inc as a Registered User (as defined in clause 2.2).
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                <p class=" text-justify " style="font-size:13px">
                                    2.1 Nonprofits are eligible to register as Registered Users and benefit from the Services provided by SAANA, Inc either via its Website or other grant programs administered offline.

                                    <br> <br> 2.2 Once you have successfully completed the registration process (including but not limited to completion of the Due Diligence Process set out in clause 2.5), you will be deemed a “Registered User”, and your registration shall continue for an indefinite period, subject to the satisfaction of any subsequent due diligence in accordance with clause 9, termination rights in accordance with clause 15 and SAANA, Inc's suspension and withdrawal rights in accordance with clause 16. For the avoidance of doubt, once the registration process is complete, the Registered User will be deemed as authorized by the Nonprofit unless there is evidence indicating fraud, as determined by SAANA, Inc.

                                    <br> <br> 2.3 SAANA, Inc receives Donations made through the Website and offline. Donations are made to SAANA in their entirety and not to Nonprofits. When making Donations, Donors may request how they wish funds to be allocated to projects listed on the Website. SAANA acknowledge such requests of Donors and while they will endeavor to ensure that Donations reach the project chosen by the Donor, SAANA Board retains sole discretion regarding the onward distribution of Donations to Nonprofits (so as to ensure appropriate handling and compliance).

                                    <br> <br> 2.4 By completing the registration process, you agree and acknowledge that:

                                    <br> <br> (i) a project is retired or fully funded;

                                    <br> <br> (ii) SAANA receives a Donation without reference to a specific project or campaign;

                                    <br> <br> (iii) a Nonprofit does not have an active account due to not having completed the renewal Due Diligence Process required pursuant to clause 2.5 of these Terms of Service;

                                    <br> <br> (iv) a Nonprofit does not provide correct disbursement information within a reasonable timeframe after at least two reminder emails have been sent to the Nonprofit to update or provide such disbursement information;

                                    <br> <br> (d) the Nonprofit and/or its projects may be included on SAANA, Inc's associated websites including any partner or client websites;

                                    <br> <br> (e) some Donors may use filter options on the Website (e.g. by a specific theme, region, size of projects, etc.) which may result in some of a Nonprofit’s projects not being seen on the Website by such Donors; and

                                    <br> <br> (f) SAANA, Inc cannot ensure receipt of any minimum amounts of Donations and some or all of a Nonprofit’s projects may not receive any Donations.

                                    <br> <br> 2.5 SAANA, Inc reserves the right to decline any registration, terminate any grant, and refuse or suspend Nonprofits or individual projects from being listed on the Website for any reason without further explanation. At the time of registration and at a minimum every two years thereafter, SAANA, Inc will undertake such checks as are necessary to verify or re-verify the identity and objectives of the Nonprofit (the “Due Diligence Process”).

                                    <br> <br> 2.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Service, SAANA, Inc reserves the right to introduce new services and update or withdraw any of the Services, in its sole discretion, and will not be liable to the Nonprofit for exercising this discretion.

                                    <br> <br> 2.7 If SAANA, Inc decides to transfer Donations made by Donors, to the Nonprofit, you acknowledge that SAANA, Inc will not be able to process such transfers until:

                                <p class=" text-justify " style="font-size:13px">

                                    <br><br> 9.1 Receipt of Donations: As set out in clauses 2.3 and 2.4 above, Donations made to projects on the Website are made to SAANA, Inc and re-granted at SAANA, Inc's absolute discretion to Nonprofits.

                                    <br><br> 9.2 Processing of Donations: Donations that SAANA decides to grant to a Nonprofit will be processed and held by SAANA on the Nonprofit’s behalf and SAANA may refuse to process and hold Donations if it is not reasonably satisfied that:

                                    <br><br> (a) the transaction is legal and not related to fraudulent activities of any kind;

                                    <br><br> (b) the Donations have been properly authorized; or

                                    <br><br> (c) the information on which SAANA is basing the transfer is correct.

                                    <br><br> 9.3 Payment Schedule for Donations paid through the Website: SAANA, Inc will transfer cleared Donations that it has received and resolved to pay to a Nonprofit, which was made during the previous month including other pending funds and/or bonuses to the Nonprofit on or around the 25th of the month. By way of example, Funds raised in June will be sent to an organization on or near the 25th of July. In relation to Funds being remitted outside of the United States, SAANA, Inc will only remit the Funds if they exceed USD 250 in value (the “Transfer Minimum”). The Overseas Transfer Minimum is based on limitations set by SAANA, Inc's disbursement partners and helps reduce the overall cost of wire fees, the negative effects of chargebacks and donation reversals

                                    <br><br> 9.4 Bank Details: The bank account information you provide SAANA, Inc as part of the registration process will be used for executing all future transfers that SAANA, Inc makes to you unless you inform SAANA, Inc otherwise or a transfer is rejected by the recipient bank. You are responsible for ensuring that SAANA, Inc is kept informed of the correct and up-to-date details. Any changes to the details must be submitted through the Registered User’s online SAANA, Inc Online Account by an authorized representative of the Nonprofit and within a sufficient period of time before a transfer is due to be made. If you provide us with (or let us continue to use) incorrect or out-of-date information, we will not be responsible if the payment is not made, it is delayed or it is made incorrectly.

                                    <br><br> 9.5 Refunds: If after a Donation has been transferred by either SAANA to your account, such Donation is thereafter rejected or reversed for any or no reason, including payments made in error, credit card chargebacks, refund requests, suspected or actual fraud, in whole or in part, you will be liable to refund such rejected Donation amount in full to SAANA. You hereby authorize SAANA to deduct any such amount and any directly related out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable administrative costs incurred by it in this context from your SAANA, Inc Online Account. If this is not possible, you are liable for reimbursing SAANA, and such an amount shall be treated as a debt.
